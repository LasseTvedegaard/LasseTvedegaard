### Hi there 👋

I'm a computer science student passionate about building software and eager to learn new technologies. Here's a bit about me:

- 👨‍💻 Currently in my final semester of CS studies, focusing on enhancing my programming and system development skills.
- 🔄 I've recently migrated all my projects from my old UCN (school account: https://github.com/LasseTN) GitHub account to this one.
- 🎵 When not coding, I teach music, blending the art of sound with the science of programming.
- 🚀 I'm on the lookout for opportunities where I can contribute and grow as a developer in an IT firm.
